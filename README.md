# Python Basics Project

This repository contains simple Python scripts developed for an introductory programming class. The goal is to practice the fundamental concepts of Python such as printing text, using variables, conditional statements, and loops.

## 1. Purpose

This project was created to demonstrate the core concepts of Python programming. Each script focuses on one or more of the following:

- Displaying text in the console (`print`)
- Using variables and data types
- Performing basic arithmetic operations
- Applying conditional logic (`if`, `elif`, `else`)
- Using loops (`for`, `while`)
- Getting user input and displaying output

## 2. How to Run

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/python-basics-project.git
   cd python-basics-project
   ```
